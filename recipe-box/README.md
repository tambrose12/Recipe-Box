# Phase 2 Project - Recipe Box
## Created in React.js by Kevin Tom Duggan, Taylor Ambrose, and Grace Nieboer

This project is the culmination of skills learned for during Flatiron School's Phase 2, focused on React.js. 

The Recipe Box was created as a way to virtually store and acces your favorite recipes from anywhere. Have you ever found the exact recipe online you were looking for and clicked the link, only to have to go through the endless scroll of reading the author's life story before getting to the actual recipe? We know the feeling all too well, and wanted to bring the Recipe Box user exactly what they came for, without the endless scroll. We hope you enjoy your life-storyless recipe :) 

We created our own db.json file rather than an API so that we could customize the data structure for our purposes. 
The db.json file is located in a separate repository to give us the option to deploy the site at a later time.

For the visual styling element of the application, we installed Semantic UI CSS  paired with some of our own custom CSS classes. 

We implemented one custom hook to dynamically render our ingredient list; this custom hook is located in the hook.js component, and all code for the hook is credited to the great wizard, *Adam La Rosa*.








### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
