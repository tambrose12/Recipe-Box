## About the Project

The Recipe Box was created as a way to virtually store and acces your favorite recipes from anywhere. Have you ever found the exact recipe online you were looking for and clicked the link, only to have to go through the endless scroll of reading the author's life story before getting to the actual recipe? We know the feeling all too well, and wanted to bring the Recipe Box user exactly what they came for, without the endless scroll. We hope you enjoy your life-storyless recipe :)

### Built With

* React.js
* JavaScript
* Semantic UI

* **Collaborators** - [Kevin Tom Duggan](https://github.com/Duggan1) [Grace Nieboer](https://github.com/gnieb), [Taylor Ambrose](https://github.com/tambrose12)
* additional credit below to Adam La Rosa

### **API's Used**
We created our own db.json file rather than an API to customize the data structure for our purposes. The db.json file is located in a separate repository to give us the option to deploy the site at a later time.

## Installation
1. Fork and Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tambrose12/Recipe-Box
   ```

## Usage

The user can maintain their virtual recipe box; they can read individual recipe cards in the box, and add, remove, or modify the recipe cards. Users can 'like' their favorite recipes as well. Recipes in the box can be easily found with filter and search features.

## Favorite Features


We implemented one custom hook to dynamically render our ingredient list; this custom hook is located in the hook.js component, and all code for the hook is credited to the great wizard, Adam La Rosa.
