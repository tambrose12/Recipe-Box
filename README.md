This project is the culmination of skills learned for during Flatiron School's Phase 2, focused on React.js.

The Recipe Box was created as a way to virtually store and acces your favorite recipes from anywhere. Have you ever found the exact recipe online you were looking for and clicked the link, only to have to go through the endless scroll of reading the author's life story before getting to the actual recipe? We know the feeling all too well, and wanted to bring the Recipe Box user exactly what they came for, without the endless scroll. We hope you enjoy your life-storyless recipe :)

We created our own db.json file rather than an API so that we could customize the data structure for our purposes. The db.json file is located in a separate repository to give us the option to deploy the site at a later time.

For the visual styling element of the application, we installed Semantic UI CSS paired with some of our own custom CSS classes.

We implemented one custom hook to dynamically render our ingredient list; this custom hook is located in the hook.js component, and all code for the hook is credited to the great wizard, Adam La Rosa.
